<h1>Various "Survival Analysis" bits for Coursera.</h1>

In the first instance, just looking at the pattern over time of "last access time".

All people who made at least 1 access are considered. The official start course date was January 28^th 2013.

Courses are 5 weeks in duration except Introduction to Philosophy, which is 7 weeks long.

Need to decide on an end date for right censoring. For example, at what point would a last access time be forcibly cut off.

**for testing**, set this cutoff to be March 16th. People access aiplan until 23rd so 16th seems like a fair point to separate those who *might* have returned after 23rd from those who had probably dropped out. i.e. we assert "not sure what would have happened" for people who accessed on/after 16th.

People who gain course_grades.achievement_level != 'none' are excluded since their last access does not signify drop-out.

<h1>To Run the Code</h1>
A file dbConnect.R, which contains a function of the following is not in the repository to protect password disclosure.

# make a connection to MySQL. Does not default schema if no argument
conn<-function(schemaName=NULL){
   return (dbConnect(MySQL.driver, user='user', dbname=schemaName, 
                   host='host', password='password'))
}
